# STM-I-Controller-Simulation
A simple simulation of the stability of a scanning tunneling microscope with only 1 degree of freedom (vertical/z-axis) that was built for the module ESP2110. The vertical stability & convergence on a setpoint tunneling signal is maintained by a simple I-controller that uses a piezoelectric plate as its actuator. 
The goal is to attain high stability despite the presence of electrical noise that inevitably occurs due to the power supply & low current/high amplification setup. This simulation is a tool to identify areas of the setup/controller that can be optimised to improve stability despite the high electrical noise that feeds into the I-controller.
This simulation also highlights that that the electrical noise forms a positive feedback loop: background noise leads to fluctuations in the output of the I-controller, which leads to fluctuations in the actuator, which leads to fluctuations in tunnelling distance, which leads to fluctuations in the electrical signal to the I-controller which leads to more fluctuations in the actuator... etc.
